        <h2>Shaheed Bhagat Singh</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh (1907-1931) was one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. His bravery and determination to fight against the British colonization of India inspired millions of Indians to join the struggle for freedom. Singh was deeply influenced by socialism and the plight of the Indian people under British rule.</p>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Bhagat Singh was born into a Sikh family that was actively involved in the freedom movement. His familyâ€™s deep sense of patriotism made him a part of the freedom struggle from an early age. At just 23, Singh gave his life for the nation but left behind a legacy that continues to inspire generations.</p>

        <h3>Revolutionary Activities</h3>
        <p>He became involved in revolutionary activities during his adolescence and played a pivotal role in the assassination of a British officer, John Saunders, in response to the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai. He was arrested in 1929 after a bombing at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, although he ensured the bombs were non-lethal and aimed only to "make the deaf hear."</p>

        <h3>Martyrdom</h3>
        <p>On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh was executed by hanging along with Rajguru and Sukhdev. His martyrdom sparked a wave of nationalism across India.</p>
